 this was my 10th school project :)

And below is a short info which i wrote long back while creating the project :)


 Hand Cricket is a very famous game among the school kids in India and similar countries.
 Traditionally, there are two players who will be playing the game.
 The players have to perform the TOSS.
 Each player has to choose either ‘ODD’ or ‘EVEN’. 
 Both the players will (through hand gestures called ‘throws’) simultaneously signify a number   between 1 to 6.
 The number’s of both the players are ‘ADDED’ together.
 The number which is obtained by adding together will be either  a ‘EVEN’ number or  an   ‘ODD’ number.
 If it is an EVEN number , then the player who had choosen EVEN wins the TOSS and vice-versa.
 The player who wins the toss will get the opportunity to choose either ‘BATTING’ or ‘BOWLLING’.
 Now as we have one batsmen and a bowler.
 Both the players will (through hand gestures called ‘throws’) simultaneously signify a number between 1 to 6.
 If both the players point out the same number, the player who is batting gets ‘out’.
 Else, this is repeated and whatever number the batting player (batsman) keeps throwing are added and that becomes his/her score.
 After the batsman gets out, the bowling player (bowler) becomes the batting player and vice-versa. 
 Now, the process is repeated again and finally, if the original bowler scores more than the original batsman, he wins. 
 If they both score the same runs and both get ‘out’, then it is declared as a tie. 
 If the original batsman scores more than the original bowler, he wins. 
 Simple as that. I hope you understood.
 NOW LETS BEGIN , ALL THE BEST.
